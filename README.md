# [Get Wrecked](http://getwrecked.info) - [Vehicle Combat Sandbox] for Arma 3

Get Wrecked challenges players to create, customize, drive, survive and of course, destroy. Construct wheeled, armoured behemoths using a variety of building parts, then fight to the death in a race zone of choice. It's a creative vehicle combat sandbox for Arma 3 multiplayer and a mod that's in an early alpha release state. It's currently designed for small games of up to 8 players.


## Quick start

Get Wrecked is not a mod, just a mission file, so you don't need to start the Arma 3 client with any funky parameters - just ensure you have disabled all other mods as they can cause conflicts in rare cases.

If you're just looking to play - you don't need to do anything but join a server running the Get Wrecked mission file. There is a [server list available on the website](http://getwrecked.info#play), or filter 'Get Wrecked' if you are already in-game.

If you're looking to host yourself, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated server to run Get Wrecked. Simply  [download the mission.pbo](http://getwrecked.info#download) and add it to your Arma3/MpMissions folder on your server. If you're not familiar with editing the server.cfg to include a reference to the mission file, it's worth using google to find this information.
