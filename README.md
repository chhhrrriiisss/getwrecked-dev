## [Vehicle Combat Sandbox] for Arma 3 ##

Get Wrecked challenges players to create, customize, drive, survive and of course, destroy. Construct wheeled, armoured behemoths using a variety of building parts, then fight to the death in a race zone of choice. It's a creative vehicle combat sandbox for Arma 3. It's currently designed for small games of up to 12 players and is in an alpha release state.

## Quick start

Get Wrecked is technically not a mod since it only requires a mission file. If you just want to play, the easiest way is to just find a server that's currently hosting the mod and join it. You don't need to start the Arma 3 client with any funky parameters. There is a [server list available on the website](http://getwrecked.info#play).

If you're looking to host a game yourself, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated server to run Get Wrecked. Simply  [download the mission.pbo](http://getwrecked.info#download) and add it to your Arma3/MpMissions folder on your server. 

## Customization

Several aspects of the game mode can be customized. These include starting money, kill rewards, armor system and respawn timers. If you are running a one-off session, you can access them as an admin via the parameters tab in the lobby. 

If you are running a dedicated server and you want these values to persist, you need to edit the "default = #;" entries in params.hpp, which will require decompiling and then recompiling the .pbo. Seek help if you are not sure what you are doing as editing these values incorrectly may cause the mission to stop working.
