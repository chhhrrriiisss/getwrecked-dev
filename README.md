# [Get Wrecked - Vehicle Combat Sandbox](http://getwrecked.info)

Get Wrecked challenges players to create, customize, drive, survive and of course, destroy. Construct wheeled, armoured behemoths using a variety of building parts, then fight to the death in a race zone of choice. It's a creative vehicle combat sandbox for Arma 3 multiplayer and a mod that's in an early alpha release state. It's currently designed for small games of up to 8 players.


## Quick start

If you're just looking to play - you don't need to do anything but join a server running the Get Wrecked mission file. Please ensure you have disabled all other mods as they can cause conflicts in rare cases.

If you're looking to host yourself, it is strongly recommended to use a dedicated server to run Get Wrecked. Simply add the Get Wrecked .pbo to your Arma3/MpMissions folder on your server. Get Wrecked is not a mod, just a mission file, so you don't need to start the server with anything but standard parameters. If you're not familiar with editing the server.cfg to include a reference to the mission file, it's worth using google to find this information.
